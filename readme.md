## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to develop a fuzzy controller that allows the Khepera robot to navigate in its environment autonomously. By leveraging fuzzy logic principles, the robot can interpret sensor data, make real-time decisions, and avoid obstacles effectively.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is **obstacle avoidance**. The fuzzy controller is designed to process sensor inputs, assess the proximity and location of obstacles, and generate appropriate control signals to navigate around obstacles while ensuring a safe path.

## Fuzzy Logic Controller

The fuzzy controller utilizes fuzzy logic concepts to handle imprecise sensor data and make decisions based on the degree of membership in different fuzzy sets. It includes rule sets, membership functions, and defuzzification methods tailored for obstacle avoidance.

## Getting Started

To begin using the fuzzy controller for obstacle avoidance:

1. Set up the Khepera robot environment according to the instructions provided in the [Khepera robot documentation](http://authier.tabanon.free.fr/archive2006/projets/robot/SIMU_ROBOT/sim2/docs/manual.pdf) available online. This includes the necessary software installation and hardware configuration.

2. Put the github files into a folder in the EXAMPLES folder and Compile the provided C code (user.c) following the instructions provided in the [Khepera robot documentation](http://authier.tabanon.free.fr/archive2006/projets/robot/SIMU_ROBOT/sim2/docs/manual.pdf).
